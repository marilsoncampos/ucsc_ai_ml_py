    "#### 1. The Project:\n",
    "\n",
    "Perform an __Exploratory data analysis (EDA)__ on the 'Titanic' dataset and build a model to predict passenger survival.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### During the EDA process, your goal is to understand the data including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Missing values\n",
    "- Relationships between two __predictor variables__.\n",
    "- Relationships between a __predictor variable__ and the __predicted (target) variable__.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common practice is to ask questions relevant to the problem and explain what you see.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to build a __document that reads like a story__, having a 'beginning', 'middle', and an 'end'. \n",
    "\n",
    "It should include findings even if the conclusion are something like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Based on our analysis of the data, there is no indication that variable 'X' influences the Survival.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Grading:\n",
    "\n",
    "__Your grade will not depend on the peformance of your final model__. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Instead, I will focus on where you started and what steps you took to get to the report.__\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: There are many factors that influence the final MaL performance. (Including the ML algorithm selected).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Report Structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "__Your report should include the following areas:__\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Loading the data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Try to understand the field types, value distribution, missing data, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Summarize/visualize data slices and explain your findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fix missing/incorrect data fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use 'Feature engineering,' to create new features from the original data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Formulate some hypotheses about the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Build and tune the model. (I am providing a sample code for this part so you can adjust it.)\n",
    "\n",

    "Load the data for trainning and testing.\n",

    "Inspect the values for each field and indentify problems with the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are few ideas to explore:\n",
    "\n",
    "_A. Questions about ways to complete missing data._\n",
    "\n",
    "* Can I use the person title listed in the ticket to estimate age?\n",
    "* Can I use the passenger gender to estimate age?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Section 2. Hypothesis formulation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few example questions to explore:\n",
    "\n",
    "_A. Questions about features (Predictors)_\n",
    "\n",
    "* Is the size of the group a determinant factor in the survival ?\n",
    "* How is survival influenced based on passenger ticket class?\n",
    "* How does age influence survival? \n",
    "\n",
    "_B. Map two feature against survival_\n",
    "* How can we see the effect of 'Group size' and 'Age' on chances of survival?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Section 3. Feature Engineering**\n",
    " \n",
    "_A. Ideas about creating new features_\n",
    "\n",
    "* Can I use ticket information to generate information about the passenger's location on the ship? \n",
    "* Can we extract information about the title to assign passengers into groups like 'members of clergy,' 'widows,' 'soldiers,' etc.?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Section 4. Summarization of findings**\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of your hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a visual plot to help confirm or reject the premise.\n",
    "- Add comments about what you see and your conclusions.\n",

    "**Section 4. Build an initial prediction model for surviving the accident.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the template code provided:\n",

    "- Create a model using at least six features\n",
    "\n",
    "**Section 5. Tune the prediction model.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the template code provided:\n",
    "- Add comments about your findings before optimization (if any).\n",
