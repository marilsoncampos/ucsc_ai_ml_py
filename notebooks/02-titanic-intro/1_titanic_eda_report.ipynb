    "#### 2. The Project:\n",
    "\n",
    "Perform an __Exploratory data analysis (EDA)__ on the 'Titanic' dataset and build a model to predict passenger survival.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### During the EDA process, your goal is to understand the data including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Missing values\n",
    "- Relationships between two __predictor variables__.\n",
    "- Relationships between a __predictor variable__ and the __predicted (target) variable__.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common practice is to ask questions relevant to the problem and explain what you see.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to build a __document that reads like a story__, having a 'beginning', 'middle', and an 'end'. \n",
    "\n",
    "It should include findings even if the conclusion are something like this: \n",

    "\n",
    "__Your grade will not depend on the peformance of your final model__. \n",

    "__Instead, I will focus on where you started and what steps you took to get to the report.__\n",
